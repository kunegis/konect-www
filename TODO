* plots:  show sample plot for each plot type (extract them from the Handbook or somewhere else)
* for each statistic:  scatter plots of that statistic vs size (show the "largest" available plot) (also, add to konect-analysis/@www)
* for each statistic:  distribution and cumulative distribution plot for that statistic (also, add to konect-analysis/@www)
* metadata:  add a line stating whether the network is connected or not 
* Have a page about matrix decompositions (/decompositions/)
* Have a page for selected families of networks (/families/)
* check programmatically that the 'name' of networks is unique over all networks
* in the metadata section of weighted networks:  show a line summarizing the possible weights 
* statistics:  for each statistic, show using icons to which types of networks it applies 
* statistic:  on each statistic page, insert a phrase describing to which group of networks the statistic applies 
* plot:  show network name, and have a link to the network (don't know how to make this beautiful)
* main page:  show three example graphs for each group:  3 statistics, 3 plots, 3 networks, etc. 
* statistics/loops/:  don't calculate and show it for networks that don't have loops 
* have a page explaining all metadata, linked from each icon 
* network:  for each statistic, show the percentile of the network for that statistic
* networks/ table and other tables:  make it sortable (needs Javascript :/)
