== Requirements ==

* bibtex2html
* ImageMagick (convert)

== Fixes ==

For the "convert" program (part of ImageMagick), we needed to perform the fixes
as described at

https://alexvanderbist.com/2018/fixing-imagick-error-unauthorized/

but applied to EPS and variants.

How to do this:  Edit /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml and replace

  rights="none"

by

  rights="read|write"

on the lines corresponding to EPS, PS and PSX (where X is a number).

A better fix would be to call convert with an option to ignore all security
issues.  (This is because ImageMagick assumes arbitrary input.  It does not
apply here.)
