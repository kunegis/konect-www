alcon:  The algebraic connectivity (a) of a network is the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of the network, the smallest eigenvalue being zero.  Only the network's largest connected component is considered, and all edge weights, directions, and multiplicities are ignored.  

anticonflict:  The spectral bipartite frustration (b<SUB>K</SUB>) is a measure of non-bipartivity of a graph.  The non-bipartivity applies to all graphs in KONECT that are not bipartite, as for bipartite graphs, it is by definition zero.  The non-bipartivity is a number between zero and one, equalling zero for bipartite graphs, and one for maximally non-bipartite graphs.  There are multiple measures of (non-)bipartivity possible, and this measure is based on the smallest eigenvalue of the signless Laplacian matrix K = D + A.  The measure is defined as <A href="../nonbipal/">the smallest eigenvalue of that matrix</A> (which is always nonnegative because the matrix is positive-semidefinite), multiplied by the number of nodes, and divided by eight times the number of edges.  This way to scale the smallest eigenvalues gives a value between zero and one.  The smallest eigenvalue (and thus the measure) is zero if and only if the graph has at least one bipartite connected component.  In KONECT, we restrict the computation to each graph's largest connected component.  The measure can be interpreted as an approximation to the fraction of edges that must be removed from the graph to make it bipartite.  It is analogous to the <A href="../fconflict/">spectral signed frustration</A> applied to the corresponding network with all negative edges. 

assortativity:  The degree assortativity (ρ) in a network is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient of the degree of connected nodes, measured over the set of all edges.  We additionally give the <I>p</I>-value (p<SUB>ρ</SUB>) associated with it.  This calculation does not take into account loops, edge multiplicites, edge directions or edge weights. 

avgdegree:  The average degree (d) is the average number of edges incident to a node in the network.  In networks without multiple edges, this equals the average number of neighbors of nodes in the network.  For bipartite networks, we also give average left degree (d<SUB>1</SUB>) and average right degree (d<SUB>2</SUB>).  For directed networks, there is no need to report the average outdegree and indegree, as they are always equal to each other, and both equal half the overall average degree. 

avgmult:  The average edge multiplicity (m̃) is calculated for networks in which multiple edges are allowed.  For one node pair, the edge multiplicity is the number of edges connecting these two nodes, taking into account the direction of edges in directed networks.  This statistic equals the average value of the edge multiplicity attained over all node pairs. 

clusco:  The clustering coefficient (c) equals the probability that a random chosen wedge (i.e., 2-star) is completed by a third edge to form a triangle.  Multiple edges, edge directions and loops are not taken into account.  

cluscoasym:  The directed clustering coefficient (c<SUP>±</SUP>) equals the proportion of directed 2-paths that are completed by a third edge oriented in the same direction as the 2-path. 

coco:  The size of LCC (N) refers to the size of the largest connected component (LCC) of the graph, i.e., the size of the largest set of nodes in the graph such that there are paths from any node to any other node in the set.  In directed networks, this statistics does not take into account edge directions.  Taking into account edge directions leads to the <A href="../cocos/">size of the LSCC</A>.  

cocos:  The size of LSCC (N<SUB>s</SUB>) refers to the size of the largest strongly connected component (LSCC) of a given graph. It is defined only for directed graphs and equals the size of the largest set of nodes such that there is a directed path from any node in the set to any other node in the same set.  We additionally show the relative size of the LSCC (N<SUP>rel</SUP><SUB>s</SUB>), which equals N<SUB>s</SUB> divided by the total number of nodes.  Not taking into account edge directions gives instead the <A href="../coco/">size of the LCC</A>.

conflict:  The algebraic conflict (ξ) is the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix.  It is a measure of the conflict (i.e., non-balance) present in signed networks.  For networks that are not signed, it is always zero, and thus not computed.  If the network is balanced, the value is exactly zero.  If the network is not balanced, the value is larger than zero.  

controllability:  The controllability (C) is a statistic related to considering the problem of controlling a network.  It equals the number of vertices in the network minus the size of a maximal matching in the bipartite double cover of the network.  We also report the relative controllability (C<SUB>r</SUB>), which equals C divided by the number of nodes, and thus lies between zero and one. 

dentropyn:  The relative edge distribution entropy (H<SUB>er</SUB>) measures the skewness of the degree distribution.  It is zero if all degrees are zero except for one node, and larger of the degree values are distributed over more nodes.  This statistic equals the value of the entropy divided by the maximal attainable value of the given number of nodes. 

diam:  The diameter (δ) of a network is the maximal distance between any two nodes, where the distance between two nodes is defined as the number of edges in the shortest path from one node to another.  Edge directions are not taken into account.  In networks that are not connected, the diameter of the largest connected component is reported. 

diameff50:  The 50-percentile effective diameter (δ<SUB>0.5</SUB>) equals the minimal distance such that 50% of nodes pairs are at most at that distance from each other.  Same-node pairs are included in the calculation, and the exact value is interpolated linearly between the two neighboring integers.    Edge directions are not taken into account.  In networks that are not connected, only the largest connected component is considered.  

diameff90:  The 90-percentile effective diameter (δ<SUB>0.9</SUB>) equals the minimal distance such that 90% of nodes pairs are at most at that distance from each other.  Same-node pairs are included in the calculation, and the exact value is interpolated linearly between the two neighboring integers.  Edge directions are not taken into account.  In networks that are not connected, only the largest connected component is considered. 

threestars:  The number of claws (z) equals the number of times a claw appears as a subgraph of the given graph.  A claw consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, and is also known as a 3-star. 

fconflict:  The spectral signed frustration (φ) is, for signed graphs, a measure of the conflict in the network.  It is defined as the <A href="../conflict/">algebraic conflict</A> (the smallest eigenvalue of the signed Laplacian matrix) times the number of nodes, divided by eight times the number of edges.  It approximates the fraction of edges whose sign must be switched for the graph to be balanced.  Its value lies between zero and one.  It is analogous to the <A href="../anticonflict/">spectral bipartite frustration</A>, by formally switching the sign of all edges. 

fill:  The fill (p) of a network is the probability that two randomly chosen edges are connected.  This takes into account the type of network, i.e., whether the network is directed or undirected, and whether loops are allowed.  The fill equals one when all possible edges are present.

fourstars:  The number of crosses (x) counts the number of times a cross appears as a subgraph of a given graph.  A cross is a pattern consisting of a central node connected to four other nodes, and is also known as a 4-star. 

gini:  The Gini coefficient (G) measures the skewness of the degree distribution.  It is a value between zero and one, and equals zero if all degrees are equal, and is larger when the degree distribution is more skewed. 

inoutassort:  In directed networks, the in/outdegree correlation (ρ<SUP>±</SUP>) is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the indegree and outdegree of nodes, measured over the total set of nodes. 

loops:  The number of loops (l) is simply the number of edges which start and end at the same node.  Bipartite networks cannot have loops.  Unipartite networks may or may not have loops. 

maxdegree:   The maximum degree (d<SUB>max</SUB>) of a network is the maximum number of edges incident to any individual node.  This takes into account multiple edges when they are present. In directed networks, we additionally calculate the maximum outdegree (d<SUP>+</SUP><SUB>max</SUB>) and the maximum indegree (d<SUP>−</SUP><SUB>max</SUB>).  In bipartite networks, we also calculate the separate maximum degree for left nodes (d<SUP>1</SUP><SUB>max</SUB>) and for right nodes (d<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>max</SUB>).

maxdiag:  The cyclic eigenvalue (π) is the largest absolute eigenvalue of the (generally asymmetric) adjacency matrix of a directed graph.  It is zero if and only if the graph is acyclic, i.e., when the graph does not contain any directed cycle. 

meandist:  The mean distance (δ<SUB>m</SUB>) equals the average distance between any two nodes, where the distance is defined as the number of edges in the shortest path between the two nodes.  Same-node pairs are included in the calculation.  Only the network's largest connected component is considered. 

mediandist:  The median distance (δ<SUB>M</SUB>) is the median value of the distance between any two node pairs.  This is calculated over each network's largest connected component, and takes into account pairs consisting of the same node, i.e., pairs of nodes of distance zero.  Edge weighted and signs are ignored.  Multiple edges and loops are irrelevant by definition for this statistic.  The given values are never half-integers:  Even when the median would be defined as the mean of two adjacent values, the value given is rounded up.  This case is extremely unlikely in large networks. 

negativity:  In networks with negative edges, the negativity (ζ) is the fraction of edges that are negative.  For rating networks, an edge is counted as negative if its rating value is below the global average.  The value lies between zero and one.

nonbip:  The non-bipartivity (b<SUB>A</SUB>) measures to what extent a graph deviates from a bipartite graph.  The non-bipartivity applies to all graphs in KONECT that are not bipartite, as for bipartite graphs, it is by definition zero.  The non-bipartivity is a number between zero and one, equalling zero for bipartite graphs, and one for maximally non-bipartite graphs.  There are multiple measures of (non-)bipartivity possible, and this measure is based on the spectrum of the symmetric adjacency matrix A.  It is defined as one minus the absolute value of the smallest eigenvalue divided by the largest eigenvalue.  This is based on the property of the adjacency matrix to have matching maximal and minimal eigenvalues if and only if the graph is bipartite, or to be precise, when the connected component with the largest spectral norm is bipartite.  The value of one is an upper bound, but cannot be attained itself in a loopless graph; this can be seen by the fact that the sum of eigenvalues of the symmetric adjacency matrix equals the number of loops in the graph.  We recommend this statistic as the default measure of (non-)bipartivity, as it is fast to compute even for large graphs, it correlates well with other measures, and its values are well distributed in its range. 

nonbipal:  The algebraic non-bipartivity (χ) is the smallest eigenvalue of the signless Laplacian matrix K = D + A.  It is zero if and only if at least one connected component of the graph is bipartite.  It serves as the basis for the <A href="../anticonflict/">spectral bipartite frustration</A>, a measure of the bipartivity of a graph. 

nonbipn:  The normalized non-bipartivity (b<SUB>N</SUB>) measures to what extent a graph deviates from a bipartite graph.  The non-bipartivity applies to all graphs in KONECT that are not bipartite, as for bipartite graphs, it is by definition zero.  The non-bipartivity is a number between zero and one, equalling zero for bipartite graphs, and one for maximally non-bipartite graphs.  There are multiple measures of (non-)bipartivity possible, and this measure is based on the spectrum of the normalized symmetric adjacency matrix N.  It is defined as one plus the smallest eigenvalue.  This is based on the property of the normalized adjacency matrix to have minimal eigenvalue minus one if and only if the graph is bipartite, or to be precise, when there is at least one bipartite connected component.  However, in this computation only the largest connected component is taken into account.  The value of one is an upper bound, but cannot be attained itself in a loopless graph; this can be seen by considering the trace of the normalized adjacency matrix, which is zero for loopless graphs. 

opnorm:  The operator 2-norm (ν) equals the largest singular value of a directed graph's (generally asymmetric) adjacency matrix.  It is only computed for directed graphs.  For undirected graphs, it would simply equal the spectral norm. 

own:  The balanced inequality ratio (P) is the number between zero and one such as the ratio P of nodes with highest degree account for 1 − P of all half-edges.  In this definition, each edge is considered to consist of two half-edges, each owned by one node, thus, the degree of a node is the number of half-edges owned by a node, and we can consider statements such as "5% of nodes own 95% of half-edges."  The smaller the value, the more inequality is present in the degree distribution.  The highest value of one corresponds to the case in the which all nodes have the same degree, i.e., a regular graph.  For bipartite networks, we also show the corresponding statistic restricted to left and right nodes (P<SUB>1</SUB>, P<SUB>2</SUB>).  For directed networks, we also show the corresponding statistic restricted to the outdegree and indegree (P<SUB>+</SUB>, P<SUB>&minus;</SUB>). 

power:  The power law exponent (γ) measures the slope of the degree distribution, assuming that it is a power law.  This value is computed by taking into account the complete degree distribution. 

power2:  The power law exponent (γ<SUB>t</SUB>) measures the slope of the degree distribution, assuming that it is a power law.  This value is computed by taking into account only the tail of the degree distribution.  

power3:  The power law exponent (γ<SUB>3</SUB>) measures the slope of the degree distribution, assuming that it is a power law.  This value is computed by taking into account only the tail of the degree distribution.  In addition, this calculation produced a <I>p</I>-value that indicates the probability that the degree distribution could have been produced under the hypothesis of a perfect power law with the given exponent.   For bipartite graphs, we show the corresponding left and right statistics (1,2) and for directed graphs, we show the corresponding outdegree and indegree statistics (o,i). 

reciprocity:  In directed networks, the reciprocity (y) equals the proportion of edges for which a reciprocal edge exists, i.e., for which another directed edge connects the two connected nodes in opposite direction. 

separation:  The spectral separation (|λ<SUB>1</SUB>[A] / λ<SUB>2</SUB>[A]|) equals the largest absolute eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix divided by the second largest absolute eigenvalue.  The value is at least one.  Larger values indicate "less diversity" in the network structure, in the sense that the adjacency matrix approaches a rank-one matrix.  Low values (just slightly larger than one) indicate many independent substructures in the network; this can be interpreted as "more diversity", "more structure", or "more complexity". 

size:   The size (n) of a network is the number of nodes it contains.  For bipartite networks, we also give the number of left nodes (n<SUB>1</SUB>) and the number of right nodes (n<SUB>2</SUB>).

snorm:  The spectral norm (α) of a network is the largest absolute eigenvalue of a network's adjacency matrix A. 

squares:  The square count (q) counts the number of times a square appears as a subgraph of the given network.  This does not take into account multiple edges. 

tconflict:  The triadic conflict (τ) is a statistic that applies to signed, unipartite graphs.  It equals the fraction of triangles that are in conflict.  A triangle is a set of three edges that are connected to form a triangle, i.e., a set of three nodes that are all mutually connected.  In a network that has positive as well as negative edges, we can consider the balance of a triangle:  A triangle is balanced when it is consistent with the usual interpretation of positive and negative edges.  For instance, a triangle consisting of two negative edges and one positive edge is balanced because it can be interpreted as "The enemy of my friend is my enemy."  Following similar reasoning, a triangle ends up being balanced when it has an odd number of negative edges.  Conversely, a triangle that is not balanced is considered to be in conflict.  This statistic measures the fraction of triangles in the network that are in conflict.  It ranges from zero to one, and equals zero when all triangles are balanced, and equals one when all triangles are in conflict.  It is undefined if the network does not contain triangles, and thus is not computed for bipartite graphs.  For non-bipartite graphs that do not contain negative edges, it is trivially equal to zero, and thus we do not report the statistic for such networks. 

tour4:  The 4-tour count (T<SUB>4</SUB>) counts the number of 4-tours in the graph.  A 4-tour is defined as a walk of length four that ends at its starting node, and that is allowed to take the same node or edge twice. 

triangles:  The number of triangles (t) counts the number of times that a triangle appears as a subgraph in the network, i.e., the number of groups of tree nodes that are all connected to each other.  Multiple edges and edge weights, as well as loops, are ignored for the calculation.  This statistic is not shown for bipartite networks, as it would be zero for them. 

twostars:  The number of wedges (s) counts the number of times a wedge appears as a subgraph of the given network, not taking into account multiple edges.  A wedge consists of three nodes, two of which are connected, and is also known as a 2-star, 2-path, or cherry. 

uniquevolume:  The unique edge count (m̿) of a network is the number of edges it contains, not taking into account multiple edges.  In other words, it is the number of node pairs that are connected by at least one edge. This statistic is only computed for networks in which multiple edges are allowed.

volume:  The volume (m) of a network is the number of edges it contains.  This does take into account multiple edges, if they are present.
