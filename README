KONECT-WWW
==========

This is the code to generate the website of the KONECT project, by
Jérôme Kunegis at the University of Namur.  

KONECT is a project in the area of network science with the goal to
collect and analyse network datasets.  The KONECT website shows all
network datasets in KONECT, as well as all computed network statistics,
network plots, and other analyses.  It also allows downloading of
datasets. 

This website is not yet online.  An archaic version of it is maintained
by the University of Koblenz-Landau (Germany) at

http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/

Overview
--------

The website is fully static.  That is, it can be browsed on the World
Wide Web, or locally.  The website is generated by code in this project,
which heavily relies on the Stu tool, also developed at the University
of Namur:

https://github.com/kunegis/stu

The website also uses results of the KONECT analysis, which is generated
by the KONECT-Analysis package: 

https://github.com/kunegis/konect-analysis

To build this website, execute 'stu' in this directory.
